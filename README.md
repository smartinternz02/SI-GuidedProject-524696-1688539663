# Suicide-in-India-visualisations-using-Tableau

Welcome to the repository for the "Suicide in India Visualizations using Tableau" project. This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the patterns and trends of suicide cases in India from 2001 to 2012. By leveraging the power of Tableau, we have created interactive visualizations that allow users to explore various aspects of suicide data, including demographics, causes, and regional distribution.

**Project Structure:**

1. **Demo.mp4:** This video provides a demonstration of the project, showcasing the key features and functionalities of the Tableau visualizations. It serves as a visual guide for users to better understand the project's capabilities.

2. **Project_Report(Suicides in India).pdf:** The project report offers an in-depth analysis of the suicide data, highlighting significant findings, methodologies employed, and the interpretation of visualizations. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the project's objectives and outcomes.

3. **README.md:** This file provides essential information about the project, including its purpose, structure, and instructions for installation and usage. It acts as a central hub for accessing relevant project resources and understanding the overall project workflow.

4. **Assignments:** This directory contains individual assignments submitted by the project team members. It includes PDF files named after each team member, containing their respective contributions and deliverables related to the project.

5. **Project Files:** This directory contains all the necessary files and resources related to the project.

    a. **Dataset:** The "Suicides in India 2001-2012.csv" file contains the raw data used for the project. It includes detailed information about suicide cases, such as gender, age group, education level, causes, and state-wise distribution.

    b. **Website:** This directory contains the web application built for the project. The Flask framework is utilized for developing the application, and the "Selecao" subdirectory holds the necessary files for running the web app. It includes files such as "app.py," which contains the application's backend logic, and "index.html," which represents the main web page for user interaction.

We encourage you to explore the project resources and leverage the Tableau visualizations to gain insights into the complex dynamics of suicide cases in India. Feel free to refer to the project report and individual assignments for a more comprehensive understanding of the project's methodologies and analyses.

Thank you for your interest in our project, and we hope it proves to be a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding and addressing the issue of suicide in India.
